The Ripple Java Library
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ripple/ripple-lib-java.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ripple/ripple-lib-java)

Java version of ripple-lib (alpha work in progress)

Currently looking for java/android developers to help evolve this library/api.

Please open an issue with any questions/suggestions.

The goal for this is to be an implementation of ripple-types, binary
serialization, with a websocket library agnostic implementation of a client,
which will track changes to accounts balances/offers/trusts, that can be used as
the basis for various clients/wallets.

### Current status
  
  - sjcl.json aes/ccm for (wallet) blob decryption
  - Binary serialization/parsing/shamap
  - Crude implementation of a high level client
    - Single threaded
    - High level helper classes
      - AccountTransactionsRequester (wraps account_tx)
      - PaymentFlow (wraps path_find)
    - Automatic transaction resubmission
      - Resubmits transactions in manner resilient to poor network conditions
  - Api client choice of websocket transport
  - Test suite for core types
  - Signing / Verification
  - KeyPair creation
  - Android example
    - Multi threaded
    - Send XRP and IOUs
  - Inlined version of BouncyCastle 1.60
    - Provider name: "BC"
    - Package name: org.bouncycastle
  - CLI example

### TODO
